# Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the proposed refactoring strategy for the project. The goal is to improve the application's robustness, maintainability, and adherence to modern best practices.

## 1. Project Setup and Configuration

- **Upgrade Dependencies**: Upgrade all outdated dependencies to their latest stable versions.
- **Migrate to ESLint**: Replace TSLint with ESLint and configure it with a recommended ruleset for Angular projects.
- **Optimize Build Configuration**: Adjust the build settings in `angular.json` to improve performance and reduce bundle sizes.
- **Update TypeScript Configuration**: Enable stricter type-checking options in `tsconfig.json` to enhance code quality.

## 2. Code Quality and Structure

- **Enforce a Consistent Coding Style**: Introduce a code formatter like Prettier and configure it to enforce a consistent coding style across the entire codebase.
- **Refactor Large Components**: Break down large components into smaller, more manageable ones that are easier to test and maintain.
- **Implement a State Management Solution**: Introduce a state management library like NgRx or Akita to manage the application's state in a predictable and scalable way.

## 3. Component Architecture

- **Decompose the AppComponent**: Break down the `AppComponent` into smaller, more focused components, such as a `ChordDisplayComponent`, `ControlsComponent`, and `ChordSelectorComponent`.
- **Introduce Smart and Dumb Components**: Refactor the components to follow the smart and dumb component pattern. The `AppComponent` will be the smart component, responsible for managing the application's state, while the other components will be dumb components, responsible for rendering the UI and emitting events.

## 4. Styling and CSS Architecture

- **Adopt a CSS Methodology**: Introduce a CSS methodology like BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) to create a more consistent and maintainable CSS architecture.
- **Use a CSS Preprocessor**: Introduce a CSS preprocessor like Sass to enable the use of variables, mixins, and other features that will make the stylesheets more modular and easier to maintain.
- **Create a Design System**: Create a design system that defines the application's colors, typography, and other visual elements. This will ensure a consistent look and feel across the entire application.

## 5. Data Models and Interfaces

- **Improve the Chord Model**: Update the `Chord` interface to include additional information about the chords, such as the chord type (major, minor, etc.), the root note, and the intervals.
- **Create a Voicing Model**: Create a new `Voicing` interface that provides more information about the voicings, such as the difficulty, the position on the fretboard, and the notes in the voicing.

## 6. Testing and Automation

- **Improve Test Coverage**: Write additional unit and integration tests to increase the test coverage and ensure the application's stability.
- **Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the testing and deployment process.

## 7. Documentation

- **Add Comprehensive Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the project, including a README file, architecture overview, and code-level documentation.
