# Responsive Design Implementation Plan

This document outlines the specific CSS changes required to make the application's UI fully responsive.

## 1. App Component (`src/app/app.component.css`)

The existing media queries are a good start, but they need to be more comprehensive.

- **At 768px:**
  - The `.main-card` should have more vertical padding.
  - The `.app-container` should have its `max-width` adjusted to be closer to `100%`.

- **At 480px:**
  - The main font sizes should be reduced slightly to improve readability.
  - The padding on the `.app-container` and `.main-card` should be further reduced.

## 2. Chord Display Component (`src/app/chord-display/chord-display.component.css`)

This is where the most significant changes are needed.

- **`.chord-display`:**
  - Add `flex-wrap: wrap;` to allow the items to stack vertically on small screens.
  - `justify-content` should be changed to `center` to ensure the items are centered when they wrap.

- **`.fretboard-wrapper`:**
  - The `clamp` function should be adjusted to allow for a smaller minimum width. A `min-width` of `100%` on mobile would be ideal, with a `max-width` to prevent it from becoming too large on tablets.

- **`.chord-info`:**
  - Remove the `margin-left` on smaller screens, as the items will be stacked.
  - `text-align` should be set to `center`.

## 3. Controls Component (`src/app/controls/controls.component.css`)

The controls also need to wrap on smaller screens.

- **`.progression-selection`:**
  - Add `flex-wrap: wrap;` and `justify-content: center;` to ensure the buttons stack and center correctly.

- **`.section-header`:**
  - On smaller screens, change `flex-direction` to `column` and `align-items` to `flex-start` to stack the title and the controls vertically.

## 4. Chord Selector Component (`src/app/chord-selector/chord-selector.component.css`)

The grid of chords needs to be adjusted for smaller screens.

- **`.chord-grid`:**
  - Reduce the number of columns in the grid on smaller screens using media queries. `grid-template-columns` should be adjusted to show fewer chords per row.

By implementing these changes, the application will be fully responsive and provide a much-improved user experience on mobile devices.
